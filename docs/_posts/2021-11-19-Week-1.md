If you haven't filled out the form, please do so [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeF45mZSJVTC3N1WWwz343F0-DFy2hH62ptmithSPhVsZeEiA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Also, please join our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/w6zX8HeuNq).

## Club Plan

The current plan of the club is to start with a learning phase and then move to a building phase. The learning phase will allow you to get to know other club members and improve your skills. Although we haven't set a length for this phase, we expect it to last 1-2 months. The next phase is where the whole club will work together on a single game. Our goal is to finish it by the end of the school year and publish it to steam.

## Members

The goal of this club is ambitious, so we encourage you to recruit friends that may be interested in joining. Anyone can sign up at [WestdaleGames.com](https://westdalegames.com)

## What To Expect Moving Forward

In the next couple of days, we will get everyone settled into one or more teams. We will likely do a few more weekly meetings with the entire club, then move to team-specific meetings. Each team will collaborate on projects, share skills, and prepare for the building phase.

## Contact

If you have any questions, discord is the best place to ask. Also, feel free to chat with other members in the general channel or team-specific ones.
